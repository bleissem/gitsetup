gitsetup.exe - Git on Windows
========

A clean and simple setup specifically designed to install Git on Windows. Git is installed and seamlessly integrated into your PATH to work from any command prompt. Special shortcuts and "Git command prompt from here" shell extensions are unnecessary. This is pure Git on Windows.

gitsetup.exe is a Burn Bundle (see the [WiX toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/)) that contains a single Windows installer package (.msi). The Windows installer package provides a robust, transacted installation for msysGit.
