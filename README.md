gitsetup.exe - Git on Windows
========

A clean and simple setup specifically designed to install Git on Windows. Git is installed and seamlessly integrated into your PATH to work from any command prompt. Special shortcuts and "Git command prompt from here" shell extensions are unnecessary. This is pure Git on Windows.

gitsetup.exe is a Burn Bundle (see the [WiX toolset](http://wixtoolset.org/)) that contains a single Windows installer package (.msi). The Windows installer package provides a robust, transacted installation for msysGit.

Also includes:

* [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) - GitFlow is a collection of Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for Vincent Driessen's [branching model](http://nvie.com/git-model).
* [git-credential-winstore](http://gitcredentialstore.codeplex.com/) - Windows Credential Store for Git is a small helper app designed to follow the git credentials API as defined by the [Git Documentation](https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs/blob/master/technical/api-credentials.txt).
